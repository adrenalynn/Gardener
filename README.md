# Gardener

This mod adds a gardener job that can be used to harvest grass (of any type) and also convert dirt to grass.

## Usage
The Gardener science has to be unlocked first, it requires wheat, barley and herb farming to be unlocked first. Once unlocked the recipe for a garden hoe will be available at the workbench.
Place the hoe in one of your inventory slots and right click on the ground. A selection window pops up to allow you to choose the grass type you want and afterwards simply select the area to be worked at.
The default grass type is "Biome default", meaning it uses the same grass type of the biome the area is in.
For farming grass the area limit is 100 blocks, when "auto remove" is active the limit is 1000 blocks.

## Auto Remove
If you select the auto remove option the worker will convert all dirt blocks into grass. Stone and other blocks are ignored. Once done the job will be automatically removed again.
